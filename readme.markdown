# PARTS for 3D Printable Optics

This repo holds a number of parts created for an optical/fluorescence microscopy lab.  These parts don't warrant a repo of their own, but some or all may be useful for others doing similar work.  

Please commit source CAD files here or make a PR where things are missing. PRs for the Kitchen Sink welcome or anything else desired.  If you do come up with similar or derivative parts of your own it'd be great to have them included in this repo, or submitted back to the original of this fork, either from your own fork or as a contributor here.

Prices are given as of January 2017 through Shapeways. These are meant to be guidelines for the cost of a part and do not indicate that these parts are for sale directly through this repository.

Cut down costs by sourcing materials from your 3d printer. Need to list temps and platic types and any mesh or interlay sizings that work well.
